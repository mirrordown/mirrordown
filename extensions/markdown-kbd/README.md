# Markdown Keyboard &lt;kbd&gt;

Adds HTML Keyboard &lt;kbd&gt; support to VSCode's markdown preview.

## Overview

The `kbd` plugin renders `[[key]]` as an HTML `<kbd>` element, representing keyboard input or a key name.

```html
<kbd>key</kbd>
```

## Syntax

Wrap a key name in double square brackets:

````markdown
Press [[Enter]] to confirm.

You can combine multiple keys: [[Ctrl]] + [[Shift]] + [[P]] opens the command palette.
````

[!NOTE]
Formatting that crosses a key's brackets, such as `[[*a]]*`, renders differently by engine: markdown-it reads the key first, while remark and Sätteri have already read the emphasis when the plugin runs. Keep formatting inside or outside the brackets.
