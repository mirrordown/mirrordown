# Changelog


## 0.1.1
<sub>2026-10-28</sub>

- *(patch)*
  Fixes for steps that show up with nesting or other plugins:

  - The steps stylesheet lays out nested steps correctly. Its nested-list rule targeted `.markdown-steps` instead of the `.markdown-steps-list` class nested lists carry, so a nested list fell into the number column and overlapped the step body.
  - `remd-steps` keeps a step's title in the tree, so remark plugins that run after it, such as `remd-spoiler` in `@mirrordown/preset-remark`, also apply to the title: `@1. A ||secret||` rendered its spoiler in markdown-it but not in remark.
  - `mdit-sectionize` only wraps top-level headings in sections, as `remd-sectionize` does, and `mdit-steps` nests its body tokens inside the step: a heading in a step body, blockquote or list item opened a `<section>` that closed outside its container, which is invalid HTML.

## 0.1.0
<sub>2026-07-02</sub>

- *(minor)*
  Add the sectionize plugin set: wraps each heading and the content beneath it — up to the next heading of equal or shallower depth — in a semantic `<section data-depth="N">` element, nesting deeper headings inside their ancestors' sections to mirror the document outline. Skipped heading levels nest gracefully (an `<h3>` under an `<h1>` becomes `data-depth="3"` with no invented `<h2>` section) and content before the first heading stays unwrapped. It only wraps and never touches heading ids, so it composes with `slug`/`autolink-headings` when run first. The markdown-it and remark plugins emit identical HTML. Also bundles the `markdown-sectionize` VSCode preview extension in the extension pack.
