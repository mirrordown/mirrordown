A tab header that skips a level no longer loses content in the remark and Sätteri plugins, which dropped it and its body; they now render it as `mdit-tabs` does. In a tab's explicit `> %` body it stays in that panel as text, after any group nested there; in a group of plain `>` bodies it ends the group, and it and the lines after it follow the group as ordinary content, with the blockquotes their `>` markers give. A panel's content now also renders in document order in both plugins, rather than its body before its nested groups.
