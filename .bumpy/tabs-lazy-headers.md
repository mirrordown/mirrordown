A tab header written right after nested tab content (`> > Option C body.` then `% Code`) starts a tab in the outer group in every engine. CommonMark lazily continues the nested paragraph with it, so the remark and Sätteri plugins put it in the inner group (the tabs guide's own "Default open tab" demo showed `Code` beside `Option C`); they now read the source's `>` markers as markdown-it does, keeping the header at the depth it was written with and the blockquote structure of the lines after it. `processTabs` takes the document's source for this; the marker handling is shared with steps.
