Fixes for steps that show up with nesting or other plugins:

- The steps stylesheet lays out nested steps correctly. Its nested-list rule targeted `.markdown-steps` instead of the `.markdown-steps-list` class nested lists carry, so a nested list fell into the number column and overlapped the step body.
- `remd-steps` keeps a step's title in the tree, so remark plugins that run after it, such as `remd-spoiler` in `@mirrordown/preset-remark`, also apply to the title: `@1. A ||secret||` rendered its spoiler in markdown-it but not in remark.
- `mdit-sectionize` only wraps top-level headings in sections, as `remd-sectionize` does, and `mdit-steps` nests its body tokens inside the step: a heading in a step body, blockquote or list item opened a `<section>` that closed outside its container, which is invalid HTML.
