Add the spoiler plugin set: Discord-style `||spoiler||` click-to-reveal for inline content and images. Inline text becomes an obscured bar (per-line via `box-decoration-break`); wrap an image (`||![](…)||`) and it renders heavily blurred with a centered **SPOILER** pill, revealing the sharp image on click — Discord's image-spoiler treatment. The whole interaction is a `<label>` wrapping a visually-hidden checkbox and the content, revealed with the `:checked` sibling selector, so **no JavaScript runs** and it works in the VSCode preview. Keyboard-operable (Space) and announced as a spoiler control by screen readers. Combines with `lightbox` (`||!![](…)||`) for a spoilered image that is also click-to-zoom once revealed. The markdown-it and remark plugins emit identical HTML. Also bundles the `markdown-spoiler` VSCode preview extension in the extension pack.
