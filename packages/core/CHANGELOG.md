# Changelog

## 0.1.0
<sub>2026-10-14</sub>

- *(minor)*
  Backslash-escaped delimiters are now literal in `remd-mark`, `remd-ins`, `remd-del`, `remd-kbd`, `remd-spoiler`, `remd-sub` and `remd-sup`, as they already were in the `mdit-*` plugins: `\==not marked==` renders as `==not marked==` instead of a `<mark>`, while an escaped backslash (`\==marked==`) still allows the markup. These plugins now depend on the new `@mirrordown/core` package, which holds logic shared across Mirrordown's engines.
- *(minor)*
  `~subscript~` and `^superscript^` now parse the same way in markdown-it, remark and Sätteri: a single `~` or `^` is a delimiter run with emphasis-style flanking, its content is inline markup (spaces, emphasis, links, code and each other), and crossing runs resolve leftmost-first.

  - `mdit-sub` and `mdit-sup` used to keep the content as plain text and reject any space inside it. They now parse it as inline markup, so `~*a* b~` renders emphasis and `^a~b~c^` nests.
  - `remd-sub` and `remd-sup` are now micromark syntax extensions sharing one resolver from `@mirrordown/core` (`scriptSyntax`), instead of text scans run one after another. Crossing runs such as `^a~b^c~` no longer depend on which plugin was registered first, `~~a~~` without GFM is no longer turned into empty subscripts, and the packages drop their `unist-util-*` dependencies.
  - The sub guide now shows `remark-gfm` with `singleTilde: false`: GFM's single-tilde strikethrough, which Astro enables by default, otherwise claims `~text~` first.
- *(patch)*
  `@mirrordown/core` declares `"sideEffects": false`, so bundlers drop the parts a plugin doesn't import (the escape helpers, the sub/sup micromark syntax) without having to prove them unused.
