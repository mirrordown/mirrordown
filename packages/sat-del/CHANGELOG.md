# Changelog

## 0.1.0
<sub>2026-10-28</sub>

- *(minor)*
  `==mark==`, `++ins++` and `--del--` now pair delimiters the same way in every engine. `@mirrordown/core`'s `createDelimitedTransform` ports markdown-it's delimiter algorithm (the one markdown-it-mark and markdown-it-ins use), and the remark and Sätteri plugins run on it:

  - A closer pairs with the nearest opener: `==a ==b==` highlights only `b`, as markdown-it does.
  - Spans nest: `==a ==b== c==` is a highlight inside a highlight.
  - The extra marker of an odd-length run stays outside the span (`===a===` → `=<mark>a</mark>=`); `mdit-del` compared against `+` instead of `-` here, so its marker ended up inside.
  - `remd-del` no longer mishandles runs such as `--a --- b--` or `--+a+--`, which came from patterns copied from the ins plugin.

  New Sätteri plugins `@mirrordown/sat-ins` and `@mirrordown/sat-del`, also included in `@mirrordown/preset-satteri`. The `del` guide notes that smart punctuation, on by default in Astro, turns `--` into an en dash before the plugin runs.
- *(patch)*
  Sätteri 0.11 reads attribute blocks and definition lists the way Mirrordown's other engines do, so the Sätteri suite now covers every feature:

  - `preset-satteri` has `attrs` and `definitionList` options, on by default like the other presets, which turn on Sätteri's own `attributes` and `definitionList` features. With them, the preset renders every shared fixture as `preset-remark` and `preset-markdown-it` do.
  - The `sat-*` packages accept Sätteri 0.11 as well as 0.10 (`^0.10.5 || ^0.11.0`); Astro's Sätteri integration is still on 0.10, where the plugins work as before.
  - An attribute block ending a tab or step header (`% Tab {.tab}`, `@1. Step {.step}`) now goes on the item in `sat-tabs` and `sat-steps`, as in the other engines: Sätteri read it off the header's paragraph before recognition, and the item didn't get it.
  - `sat-ruby` parses a ruby's base and reading with the document's features, which Sätteri 0.11.3 and later tell plugins; its `features` option is only needed with an older Sätteri.
