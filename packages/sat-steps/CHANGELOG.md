# Changelog


## 0.1.1
<sub>2026-10-28</sub>

- *(patch)*
  Tab and step headers are placed by their `>` markers in remark and Sätteri, as markdown-it reads them. A header right after a paragraph, at its level, interrupts it and starts a group. A header written with a panel's or step body's own `>` is that panel's content: `% Tab` or `@1. Step` there starts a group inside it, and a nested header (`%%`, `@@`) with nothing to nest in stays text. Before, both became the next tab or step of the outer group.
- *(patch)*
  A line written without a tab panel's or step body's `>` right after the last panel now starts a paragraph after the group in remark and Sätteri, as markdown-it reads it, instead of continuing the panel's last paragraph (CommonMark's lazy continuation). The lines after it, and attributes ending them, go with it.
- *(patch)*
  An alert (`> [!NOTE]`) after a step, with a blank line between, is now a block of its own after the steps in every engine, whether or not the alerts plugin reads it. A plain quote there still continues the last step's body. markdown-it took the alert into the body as text, and remark into the body without its title.

## 0.1.0
<sub>2026-10-28</sub>

- *(minor)*
  New `@mirrordown/sat-steps`: numbered step sequences (`@1. Title` with `>` bodies) for Sätteri, with the same output as `remd-steps` and `mdit-steps`, and included in `@mirrordown/preset-satteri` along with its stylesheet. Step recognition moves into `@mirrordown/core` (`processSteps`), which `remd-steps` now uses too; its output is unchanged.
- *(patch)*
  `@mirrordown/sat-steps` writes back only the parts of the tree that step recognition changed, through core's new `editableTree`, so every node it leaves alone stays Sätteri's own and keeps its source position for the plugins after it (tabs reads positions to end a group at a blank line). It also recognizes a step header directly after a list marker (`- @1. Step`), as the remark and markdown-it plugins do.
- *(patch)*
  A step header written right after nested content (`> > Quoted.` then `@2. Next`) starts the next step in every engine. CommonMark lazily continues the nested paragraph with it, so the remark and Sätteri plugins rendered the header as text inside the previous step; they now read the source's `>` markers as markdown-it does, recovering the header and the blockquote structure of the lines after it. `processSteps` takes the document's source for this.
- *(patch)*
  Paragraphs in tab panels and step bodies keep what they had when recognition splits them around a header:

  - A hard break (`line\` then `more`) stays a `<br>` in `remd-tabs`, `remd-steps`, `sat-tabs` and `sat-steps`; it became a plain line break, unlike in `mdit-tabs` and `mdit-steps`.
  - Text split around a header keeps its source position, and the lines left together are one text node again, as remark gives them.
  - In `sat-tabs` and `sat-steps`, a paragraph keeps the attributes Sätteri read from its end. A header right after a panel's last paragraph continues that paragraph in CommonMark, so Sätteri saw the paragraph's attribute block mid-paragraph; with Sätteri's `attributes` feature on, the plugins now place that block once the header is split off, where Sätteri would have.
  - `mdit-tabs` and `mdit-steps` give the panel's opening token its body as `meta.attrsSource`, since the tokens inside index the body's lines, so `mdit-attrs` can read a line's indentation there.
- *(patch)*
  Sätteri 0.11 reads attribute blocks and definition lists the way Mirrordown's other engines do, so the Sätteri suite now covers every feature:

  - `preset-satteri` has `attrs` and `definitionList` options, on by default like the other presets, which turn on Sätteri's own `attributes` and `definitionList` features. With them, the preset renders every shared fixture as `preset-remark` and `preset-markdown-it` do.
  - The `sat-*` packages accept Sätteri 0.11 as well as 0.10 (`^0.10.5 || ^0.11.0`); Astro's Sätteri integration is still on 0.10, where the plugins work as before.
  - An attribute block ending a tab or step header (`% Tab {.tab}`, `@1. Step {.step}`) now goes on the item in `sat-tabs` and `sat-steps`, as in the other engines: Sätteri read it off the header's paragraph before recognition, and the item didn't get it.
  - `sat-ruby` parses a ruby's base and reading with the document's features, which Sätteri 0.11.3 and later tell plugins; its `features` option is only needed with an older Sätteri.
