# Changelog


## 0.2.0
<sub>2026-11-11</sub>

- *(minor)*
  Require Sätteri 0.11.3 or later, which Astro ships from 7.4.7 (`@astrojs/markdown-satteri` 0.4.7). The plugins now read the document's features from Sätteri itself, so in Astro `satteriRuby()` needs no `features` passed to it, and tabs and steps no longer allow for a Sätteri that passes none. On Astro 7.4.6 or earlier, update Astro first.

## 0.1.0
<sub>2026-10-28</sub>

- *(minor)*
  Sätteri ports of the hast plugins: `@mirrordown/sat-squeeze-paragraphs`, `sat-unwrap-images`, `sat-sectionize`, `sat-lightbox` and `sat-autolink-headings`, all included in `@mirrordown/preset-satteri` (whose stylesheet now also imports the lightbox and autolink-headings styles). Their output is identical to the markdown-it and rehype plugins'. `sat-autolink-headings` takes the same options as `remd-autolink-headings`, including the hast-node ones (`content`, `group`, `properties`, `headingProperties`, `test`).

  The rules these engines must compute identically move into `@mirrordown/core` (`isEmptyParagraph`, `isImageParagraph`, `sectionize`, `headingRank`, and the lightbox's marker, ids and markup), which the rehype plugins now use too; their output is unchanged, and squeeze-paragraphs and unwrap-images drop `hast-util-whitespace`.
- *(patch)*
  Sätteri 0.11 reads attribute blocks and definition lists the way Mirrordown's other engines do, so the Sätteri suite now covers every feature:

  - `preset-satteri` has `attrs` and `definitionList` options, on by default like the other presets, which turn on Sätteri's own `attributes` and `definitionList` features. With them, the preset renders every shared fixture as `preset-remark` and `preset-markdown-it` do.
  - The `sat-*` packages accept Sätteri 0.11 as well as 0.10 (`^0.10.5 || ^0.11.0`); Astro's Sätteri integration is still on 0.10, where the plugins work as before.
  - An attribute block ending a tab or step header (`% Tab {.tab}`, `@1. Step {.step}`) now goes on the item in `sat-tabs` and `sat-steps`, as in the other engines: Sätteri read it off the header's paragraph before recognition, and the item didn't get it.
  - `sat-ruby` parses a ruby's base and reading with the document's features, which Sätteri 0.11.3 and later tell plugins; its `features` option is only needed with an older Sätteri.
